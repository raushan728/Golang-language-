## ▶️ How to Run Go Files

Make sure Go is installed. Then:

### Run a Go file:
```bash
go run filename.go
```

**Examples:**
```bash
go run 01_main.go
go run 02_Variables.go
go run 03_println_and_printf.go
go run 04_UserInput.go
go run 05_Functions.go
```

### Build an executable:
```bash
go build filename.go
```

**Examples:**
```bash
go build 01_main.go    # Creates 01_main.exe (Windows)
go build 02_Variables.go
```

### Run all files in the directory:
```bash
go run .
```
